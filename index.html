<p>Before 1974, this area was part of Klang. The town was developed by Sime UEP Properties Berhad, the property development arm of the Malaysian conglomerate Sime Darby. The site was formerly a rubber plantation called Seafield Estate under the municipality of Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya. Construction work for the development of Subang Jaya began on 21 February 1976 and was concluded in 1988. Upon completion of Subang Jaya in the same year, Sime UEP began clearing land for the development of USJ.[citation needed] In 1999, Sime UEP began the development of Putra Heights.

In 1997, <strong>Subang Jaya</strong> was granted the status of a municipality, elevating the Petaling District Council (Majlis Daerah Petaling) to Subang Jaya Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya).[1][2] Its municipal area comprised the areas administered by the former Petaling District Council, as well as some areas transferred from Petaling Jaya and Shah Alam city councils. The MPSJ holds local government authority not only in Subang Jaya town centre, but also USJ, Putra Heights, Batu Tiga, Bandar Sunway, Puchong, Bandar Kinrara, Seri Kembangan, Balakong, and other parts of southern Petaling district (although some jurisdictional areas such as USJ, Bandar Sunway and Taman Mutiara Subang also falls under partial or full jurisdiction of MBPJ and MBSA). In parliamentary terms, Subang Jaya's municipal area covers the parliamentary constituency of Puchong in its entirety, as well as parts of Kelana Jaya, Serdang and Kota Raja. Subang Jaya town itself lies within Kelana Jaya constituency, while Seri Kembangan falls within Serdang constituency.</p>
<p>The most renowned recreation park in Subang Jaya is the Subang Ria Park, situated nearby the Sime Darby Medical Centre in SS12. On the other hand, the Subang Jaya Municipal Council Complex (a.k.a. MPSJ Stadium) is the headquarters of the municipal office situated in USJ 5. It comprises a large football turf and an athletic running field. Hypermedia library, petting zoo and art gallery can be found at Kompleks 3C MPSJ in SS13.

There are many indoor soccer centres, squash, tennis and badminton courts in the town. <em>Golf clubs include the Subang Racquet and Golf Club, Subang National Golf Club Glenmarie Golf and Country Club and Saujana Golf and Country Club</em>. There are many fitness centres in USJ and Subang Jaya.

MinNature is one of the latest recreational place to be established in Subang Jaya. Located at Level 4, Summit USJ, MinNature claims to be the world largest 3D printed miniature wonderland.</p>
